# Chomp-Game-with-Scheme
Chomp game implementation with Scheme programming language.

Chomp is a game played by two players. In this game, cookies are laid out on a rectangular grid. The cookie
in the top left position is poisoned, as displayed in Figure 1-a. The two players take turns making moves; at
each move, a player is required to eat a remaining cookie, together with all cookies to the right and/or below
it (see Figure 1-b, for example). The loser is the player who has no choice but to eat poisoned cookie.
Design and implement this game in Scheme by ensuring one player is computer; the other one is user.

ChompGame.scm is my implementation for that exercise.
